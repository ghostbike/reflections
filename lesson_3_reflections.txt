When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share your work, especially when you're working with other developers on a 
    project that you want to collaborate on. Also from a portfolio perspective you
    want to be able to demo or show things without having your computer there.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    happen is changes submitted by another user flows down to your local repository
    without you knowing about it, corrupting your work.
